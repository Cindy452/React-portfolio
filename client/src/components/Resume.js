            <p>I was an administrative assistant in the construction and transportation field. After three years experience, I realize the way I didn't grow. So I decided to change my career to dive into web Developer industry and haven't looked back. Now I'm a self taught web developer and I am looking forward to finding a full-time position where I can offer my existing skills and talents to help my future employer, while also having the opportunity to learn and grow new skills along the way.
